- Added configuration options for controlling the amount and distribution of test data

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Configured GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Set up jobs for unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and visual regression tests
- Added artifact collection for test results and screenshots

## 2. Performance Monitoring Enhancement

We've implemented comprehensive performance monitoring to help identify and address performance issues:

### Performance Metrics Service

- Created a metrics collection service in `server/services/performance-metrics-service.ts`
- Implemented tracking of API response times, database queries, system resources, and cache performance
- Added configuration options for sampling rate, retention period, and alert thresholds

### Performance Dashboard API

- Created API endpoints in `server/routes/performance-dashboard.ts` for accessing performance metrics
- Implemented endpoints for retrieving metrics, queries, system stats, and cache stats
- Added endpoints for clearing cache and getting slow queries

### Performance Dashboard UI

- Implemented a dashboard component in `client/src/components/performance/PerformanceDashboard.tsx`
- Added charts for visualizing performance metrics over time
- Implemented filtering by time range and metric type

## 3. API Documentation Expansion

We've expanded the API documentation to make it easier to understand and use the API:

### OpenAPI Examples

- Created detailed examples in `docs/openapi-examples.yaml` for all API endpoints
- Added examples for request and response bodies
- Implemented examples for error responses

### API Examples Integration

- Created a script in `scripts/integrate-api-examples.js` to integrate examples into the OpenAPI specification
- Implemented automatic matching of examples to schemas
- Added support for common responses and error examples

## 4. Mobile Experience Optimization

We've optimized the mobile experience to provide a better user experience on mobile devices:

### Progressive Loading

- Implemented a `ProgressiveLoader` component in `client/src/components/mobile/ProgressiveLoader.tsx`
- Added support for loading data incrementally as the user scrolls
- Implemented page size adjustment based on device type

### Touch Interactions

- Created a `TouchInteraction` component in `client/src/components/mobile/TouchInteractions.tsx`
- Implemented support for swipe, tap, long press, and pinch gestures
- Added configuration options for gesture thresholds and behavior

### Mobile-Optimized Components

- Implemented a mobile-optimized page in `client/src/pages/ServiceUsersPage.tsx`
- Added configuration in `client/src/config/mobile-config.ts` for mobile optimizations

### Offline Capabilities

- Implemented offline storage and synchronization
- Added conflict resolution for offline changes
- Created documentation for offline capabilities in `docs/mobile-optimizations.md`

## 5. Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation to help developers understand and use the enhancements:

### Testing Guide

- Created a testing guide in `docs/testing-guide.md`
- Documented the testing approach, directory structure, and how to run tests
- Added guidelines for writing new tests

### Mobile Optimizations Guide

- Created a guide to mobile optimizations in `docs/mobile-optimizations.md`
- Documented the progressive loading, touch interactions, and offline capabilities
- Added best practices for developing mobile-optimized features

### Setup Guide

- Created a setup guide in `SETUP.md`
- Documented the local and Docker setup options
- Added troubleshooting tips and next steps
