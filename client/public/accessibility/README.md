# CareUnity Network Accessibility Improvements

This document outlines the accessibility improvements implemented in the CareUnity Network application to ensure better usability for users with disabilities and compliance with accessibility standards.

## Implemented Features

### 1. ARIA Attributes and Keyboard Navigation Support

The application now includes:
- Proper ARIA landmarks, roles, and attributes throughout the interface
- Enhanced keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators
- Skip to content links for keyboard users
- Improved screen reader announcements for dynamic content changes
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick access to important features

### 2. Color Contrast and Text Sizing

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Customizable text size options
- High contrast mode for users with visual impairments
- Clear visual focus indicators

### 3. Additional Accessibility Features

- Reduced motion option for users with vestibular disorders
- Screen reader optimized mode with enhanced announcements
- Persistent accessibility preferences stored in the service worker
- Accessible notifications with appropriate ARIA attributes

## Technical Implementation

### Service Worker Enhancements

The service worker (`workbox-service-worker.js`) has been enhanced to support accessibility features:

1. **Accessibility preferences storage**: User preferences are stored in IndexedDB and persist across sessions
2. **Priority caching**: Accessibility-related resources are cached with high priority
3. **Enhanced notifications**: Push notifications are enhanced with accessibility metadata
4. **Offline accessibility**: Core accessibility features work even when offline

### Accessibility Components

1. **Accessibility Menu**: A floating menu that allows users to customize their experience
2. **Accessibility Utilities**: Helper functions for managing accessibility features
3. **Accessibility Stylesheets**: CSS variables and styles for implementing accessible UI

## Usage

### Adding the Accessibility Features to a Page

1. Include the accessibility stylesheet:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/accessibility/accessibility-styles.css">
```

2. Add the accessibility component to your HTML:
```html
<accessibility-menu></accessibility-menu>
```

3. Include the accessibility scripts:
```html
<script src="/accessibility/accessibility-utils.js"></script>
<script src="/accessibility/accessibility-menu.js"></script>
```

### Using the Accessibility API

From any JavaScript code, you can access the accessibility features:

```javascript
// Get user's current accessibility preferences
const preferences = await window.getAccessibilityPreferences();

// Update user's accessibility preferences
await window.updateAccessibilityPreferences({
  highContrast: true,
  largeText: true,
  fontSize: 18,
  reduceMotion: false,
  screenReaderOptimized: false,
  focusIndicators: true
});

// Make screen reader announcements
window.a11y.announce("Your message was sent successfully", "assertive");

// Set focus with announcement
window.a11y.focusElement(document.getElementById("my-element"), "Focus is now on the form");
```

## Testing and Validation

To validate the accessibility implementation:

1. Use keyboard navigation to navigate through the entire application
2. Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
3. Verify color contrast ratios using the WebAIM contrast checker
4. Enable the high contrast and large text modes to verify content remains usable
5. Test with reduced motion preferences enabled
6. Verify all interactive elements have proper focus indicators

## Future Improvements

- Advanced voice navigation capabilities
- Support for additional assistive technologies
- Implementation of ARIA 1.2 features
- Additional personalization options based on user needs
- Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
