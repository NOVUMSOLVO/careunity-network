# Security Enhancements Documentation

This document describes the security enhancements implemented in the CareUnity Network application.

## 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy has been implemented to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The policy defines the approved sources of content that the browser is allowed to load.

### Implementation

CSP is implemented through the Helmet middleware in the Express server:

```typescript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'", "https://replit.com"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://*"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "wss://*", "https://*"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'self'"],
    },
  }
}));
```

### Benefits

- Mitigates XSS attacks by controlling which resources can be loaded
- Prevents unauthorized script execution
- Restricts loading resources from unauthorized sources

## 2. Subresource Integrity (SRI)

Subresource Integrity attributes have been added to external scripts to ensure they haven't been compromised.

### Implementation

SRI is implemented by adding integrity attributes to external script and link tags:

```html
<script src="https://external-cdn.com/script.js" 
        integrity="sha384-HASH_VALUE" 
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

A script for generating SRI hashes is available at `scripts/generate-sri.js`.

### Benefits

- Ensures external resources haven't been tampered with
- Prevents loading of compromised CDN resources
- Adds an extra layer of security for third-party dependencies

## 3. Security Headers

Additional HTTP security headers have been implemented to enhance the application's security posture.

### Implementation

Security headers are managed through both the Helmet middleware and a custom middleware:

```typescript
// Custom security headers middleware
app.use(securityHeaders());
```

The headers implemented include:

- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Protects against clickjacking
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls how much referrer information is shared
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to browser features
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies**: Controls loading of cross-domain content

### Benefits

- Improves overall security posture
- Protects against various attack vectors including clickjacking, MIME type sniffing
- Enforces secure communication channels
- Provides defense-in-depth security

## Maintenance

To maintain these security enhancements:

1. Regularly update the SRI hashes when external resources change
2. Review and update the CSP policy as new resources are added
3. Keep the security headers up to date with current best practices
4. Monitor for any issues related to the security configurations

## Testing

These security enhancements can be tested using tools like:

- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
- [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/)
- Browser developer tools (Security tab)
- OWASP ZAP or other security testing tools
