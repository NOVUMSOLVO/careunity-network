## Detailed Test Findings

### Critical Issues
No critical issues were found during testing.

### Minor Issues
1. **Mobile Navigation Overlap**: On very small screens (< 320px), some navigation items overlap.
2. **Calendar Performance**: Calendar view with many appointments (>50) has slight performance lag.
3. **Form Reset**: Some forms don't reset properly after submission.

### Recommendations
1. Improve mobile layout for very small screens
2. Optimize calendar performance for large datasets
3. Implement consistent form reset behavior
4. Add more comprehensive error messages for API failures
5. Enhance offline capabilities for field workers
